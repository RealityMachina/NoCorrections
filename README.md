# NoCorrections
Removes all corrections made to hit rolls.

Specifically:

1) It no longer tries to break streaks of misses the player has

2) It no longer does added math to the hit calculation, that would make easy shots even easier, and hard shots even harder.


Note: may cause blood pressure to rise during gameplay because pure RNG has no mercy.
